To build, you must specify install path of wxWidgets with WX_WIN_PATH or make a symlink wx_win in dep to it. The install path should contain lib and include folders.

Usage of the app:
1. Open a folder containing the image files
2. Open a folder for the output of the cropped images
3. Put in the dimension of the crop (you can also change it with the button if you have an image open)
4. Click on an image in the list to open it
5. When the file list is focused for key inputs, you can click enter key to save files
